# SFX Calculator

## Summary - 
This is a calculator built in TypeScript and React with an added drum effects library. On display of the result, the sounds associated with each number are looped over and played in succession, creating a drum beat.
My goal was to add a little more fun and interactivity to a classic programming exercise. I decided to use plain CSS and the JS Audio interface to get better acquainted with native JS tools and styling that would both work in any browser today.

## Instructions - 
To run the codebase, clone the repo and type 'npm run start' or try it on the linked github pages.

### State Management - 

**useState** - Redux seemed like overkill for a small application and I wantedt to challenge myself by trying a new library. I decided localstate using the useState hook would suffice.


### Styling - 

**CSS** - I have more recently been using SCSS, styled-components, MaterialUI etc. and wanted to get back to basics by only using plain CSS as both a refresher and way to decrease bundle size.
